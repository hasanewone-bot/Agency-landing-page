## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first big project in Frontend Mentor, and I can proudly say that I like how it came out. Since the whole project was based on CSS Grid, there were so many ways to build the layout. I chose to build small blocks, and use BEM's power to use the same styling for the remaining blocks. Overall, really colorful and cool project that was another opportunity to practice CSS Grids.

### Continued development

I built a mobile responsive navbar here for the first time, and I have to admit it was easier than I thought it would be. What I plan on doing is to try to make the navbar more interactive with some animations.
